Connected to the db through CLI client
```
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-client
psql -h localhost -U postgres
```

## Homework Challenges

### Run Dockerfile CMD as an external script

1. Created **execute_script.sh** 
```
#!/bin/bash
python3 -m flash run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
```
2. Created the container while in the backend-flask directory
```
docker build -t backend-flask .
```
3. Tried running the container
```
docker run -d --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask
```
